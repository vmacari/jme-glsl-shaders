1 Update your jMonkeyPlatform with nightly builds.

2 Get the project with Mercurial: hg clone https://paulgeraskin@code.google.com/p/jme-glsl-shaders/
You will get entire JMP project with shaders and examples(tests).

3 Load this JMP project (in JMP - Open a Project). When project will be loaded, you can run some tests in "source" folder.

To get shaders to your project: copy from "assets" folder to your "assets" folder project "Shaders", "MatDefs" folders. Then create a material and make what you want. :)
